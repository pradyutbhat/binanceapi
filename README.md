# binanceapi
Integration of Binance API to source historical order data for cryptocurrencies. Get access to OHLCV data (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data of a cryptocurrency pair for a custom/origin/YTD period of time.

Binance API Doc: https://python-binance.readthedocs.io/en/latest/binance.html

Packages required: pandas.

FYI, #binanceapi is known to encounter issues for lots of compilers. Personal recommendation to use Anaconda & use Spyder for your code. Have fun!
